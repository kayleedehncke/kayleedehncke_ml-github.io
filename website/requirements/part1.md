# Module 1 Project Part 1 Assignment

## Overview

The Data Science Lifecycle begins with an idea/goal/topic and utilizes data to explore, evaluate, visualize, model, gain information, and communicate results and conclusions about that topic.

You will have the following sections on your website (DO NOT change the names):

### 1) Introduction TAB

* Call it "Introduction".
* 5+ paragraphs (each paragraph ≥ 10 sentences) in the final project.
* Include images to help understand the topic.
* Completely non-technical: focus on background, motivation, importance, affected parties, previous work, and potential future exploration.

### 2) DataPrep/EDA TAB and TABS for each model/method

* **DataPrep/EDA TAB:** Describe how, where, and why data was gathered; show raw and cleaned data; visually explore data; include links to raw data and API endpoints.
* **Model/Method TABS:** Include Clustering, PCA, DT, NB, SVM, Regression, NN.

  * **Overview:** Explain the model/method, how it works, and planned application.
  * **Data:** Show small images of prepared datasets, link to raw and cleaned data.
  * **Code:** Link to code and note language/packages (do not paste code).
  * **Results:** Discuss, illustrate, and visualize results, parameter use, and implications.

### 3) Conclusions TAB

* 100% non-technical, no discussion of models/methods.
* Explain findings in a way anyone can understand.
* 5+ paragraphs with images in the final project.

## Specific Requirements for Module 1 Project Part 1

### 1) Website Creation

* Create a website (simple or fancy).
* Add all TABS: Introduction, Conclusions, DataPrep\_EDA, Clustering, PCA, NaiveBayes, DecTrees, SVMs, Regression, NN.
* TABS are links for navigation.

### 2) Choose a Topic

* Can be health, sports, sustainability, education, farming, zoology, etc.
* **Do not** choose stock market prediction.
* Write **≥2 paragraphs** for Introduction TAB.
* Include **1+ image**.
* Under Introduction, list **10 research questions**.

#### Example Topic

Does air quality affect life expectancy and health, and do gas-powered lawn care machines negatively impact air quality and health?

### 3) Gather Data

* Use Python or R and an API (Twitter, AirNow, NewsAPI, etc.). Include code and endpoint example.
* Supplement with downloaded data (Kaggle, EPA, government sites) or self-created datasets.
* Collect both qualitative and quantitative, labeled and unlabeled data.

### 4) DataPrep\_EDA TAB Content

* Describe data collection process.
* Include small images of raw and cleaned data.
* Include links to raw and cleaned datasets.
* Provide at least **10 visualizations**.
* Visualizations must have titles, labels, colors, readable axes, and 2-sentence captions.
* Document cleaning steps: removing NAs/NaNs, handling missing or incorrect values, outliers, normalization, discretization, adding/removing columns.

### 5) Review Checklist

1. Website with all TABS.
2. Introduction TAB: ≥2 paragraphs, 1+ image, 10 questions.
3. DataPrep\_EDA TAB: raw/clean data links, images, ≥10 visualizations.
4. Code linked (do not paste).
5. Clear navigation, professional flow.

### 6) Rules for Visualizations

* Professional figures only, not screenshots.
* Figures have titles, labels, colors, readable axes, 2-sentence descriptions.
* Optional: thumbnails linking to larger images for cleaner website.
