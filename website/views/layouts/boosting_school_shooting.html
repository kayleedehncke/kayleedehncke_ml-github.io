                <p>
                    The boosting method delivered strong performance in predicting fatal outcomes in mass shootings, with all tested configurations achieving an accuracy of 0.967. 
                    Interestingly, all three setups—Config A, B, and C—performed identically in terms of accuracy, suggesting that the model is robust across a range of hyperparameter choices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While accuracy was high, the confusion matrix revealed a key limitation: the model was highly effective at identifying non-fatal incidents but struggled to correctly classify fatal ones. 
                    This imbalance may be due to the dataset's skew toward non-fatal cases, which can bias the model toward the majority class. 
                    Hyperparameter tuning had minimal impact on accuracy, but deeper trees and more estimators may still offer benefits in capturing rare patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feature importance analysis showed that “Victims Injured” remained the most influential predictor, followed by “Suspects Killed” and “Suspects Arrested.” 
                    These findings reinforce the connection between injury severity and fatality outcomes, aligning with the project's broader goal of understanding patterns in gun violence. 
                    Boosting not only provided high predictive accuracy but also surfaced meaningful insights into which variables matter most in fatality prediction.
